## Music Quiz Python

This is a simple music quiz made in Python using the "pygame" library, this serves more as a template
rather than a full-fledged game. Fell free to add your own music to it in the "songs" folder.

## How to play the game

To play the game you can either make it an .exe or just run it in your VTE.

## How to make it into an .exe
In the console of your VTE, do the following to make it into an .exe.

1. "pip install pyinstaller"
2. "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --noconsole main.py"

## How to play it in your VTE
In the console of your VTE, do the following.

1. Install pygame: "pip install pygame"
2. Run The Game: "python main.py"

## Game controlls
* Left Click To Guess
* ESC: Quit Game
* Q: Quit Game
* R: Restart Game

Q and R only work after you have lost

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

Since this not more than an template project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use
for your own purposes. This mainly serves as a template for a song guessing game. The game comes with some 
of the songs made by the artist "Ã–resus", feel free to remove the songs and add your own.
